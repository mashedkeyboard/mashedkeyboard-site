	<h2>Curtis Parfitt-Ford</h2>

	<p>
		I'm an <strong>interdisciplinary professional</strong> with clinical, technical, and academic experience
		across pre-hospital emergency care, web software engineering, and human-computer interaction. Much
		as that's an unusual set of words to put together, the breadth of my experience means I'm able to
		deliver value in unusual ways!
	</p>
	<p>
		Having founded my own company just two months after turning 17 to help campaigns I believed in
		realise their goals, I've got clear experience working in a self-motivated fashion to achieve
		key objectives. I've also developed mentorship and teaching skills, both in software teams and
		in clinical contexts: I love sharing the things I've learned, and, in turn, learning from
		others.
	</p>
	<p>
		I've a keen and curious interest in research, particularly in health technology and
		out-of-hospital urgent and emergency care. I'm beginning to develop a portfolio of work in these
		areas.

				<strong>Full Stack Developer</strong>
				at Poteris: July 2023 &mdash; present
			</summary>
			<p>
				Poteris is a non-profit agency working with organisations to create positive change through
				technology, in particular in the third sector and civic technology spaces. I started as the
				only in-house software engineer, with responsibilities including building and maintaining
				systems that manage campaign data, architecting data models for the storage of
				authentication and contact information, managing the deployment of internal and external
				systems into the AWS cloud, and writing internal documentation for contracted technology
				partners.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this role, I've worked in both TypeScript and Golang, using frameworks like Nest.js and
				Next.js, as well as performing DevOps tasks across both AWS and Vercel platforms.

				<strong>Director</strong>
				at Loudspeek: February 2019 &mdash; present
			</summary>
			<p>
				Loudspeek provides digital advocacy solutions to some of the UK's largest progressive change
				campaigns and charities. I am the founder and director, and wrote the codebase myself, which
				processes nearly 2 million user requests per month at peak. I have experience from this role
				developing with Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL and Redis, among various other technologies.
			</p>
			<p>
				In terms of soft skills, I also overcame significant adversity in the process of founding
				Loudspeek because of my age, including not being able to open a bank account for the company
				for more than six months until I finally persuaded a bank to do so.

				<strong>Computer Scientist</strong>
				at Netcraft: July to September 2022
			</summary>
			<p>
				I spent the summer between my second and third years at university working at Netcraft's
				London office as a Computer Scientist. In this role I designed and developed automated
				systems combating cybercrime, as well as exploring ways to work with both government
				agencies and upstream providers to take fraudulent content offline, protecting brands and
				consumers alike.

				<strong>SPARK Scheme Participant</strong>
				at Clifford Chance: July 2021
			</summary>
			<p>
				In my first year at university, this undergraduate placement scheme gave me an opportunity
				to experience a Magic Circle law firm. Having won my place on the scheme through my being
				awarded “Young Activist of the Year”, I gained some fascinating insights into corporate and
				commercial law, as well as opportunities to network with leading industry professionals
				&mdash; including from a selection of Clifford Chance clients, who presented to us during
				the scheme.

				<strong>Emergency Ambulance Crew</strong>
				at St John Ambulance: October 2022 &mdash; present
			</summary>
			<p>
				St John Ambulance is England's largest first aid charity, providing medical cover at events,
				in communities, and in response to emergency calls in partnership with the NHS. From 2022 to
				2025, we served as England's national Ambulance Auxiliary, meaning supporting pre-hospital
				emergency care delivery across NHS ambulance services all year round.
			</p>
			<p>
				I qualified as an Emergency Ambulance Crew with St John in October 2022. Since then, I've
				worked on double-staffed ambulances in SWAST, SCAS, IOWAS and EMAS trusts. I've also formed
				part of the medical team at a variety of significant events, ranging from Manchester and
				Brighton Prides to the Great North Run and London Marathon, working alongside other
				healthcare professionals and providing leadership and mentorship to junior members of the
				team, such as our first aiders.
			</p>
			<p>
				I regularly teach university First Aid Societies and other community groups as part of this
				role, differentiating content across an audience ranging from laypeople and schoolchildren
				to final-year medical students. I am also a qualified Cycle Responder, providing a
				fast-response capability to large events, with the ability to triage and treat patients
				without requiring a double-staffed ambulance response.

				<strong>Trustee</strong>
				at the University of Southampton Students' Union: July 2022 &mdash; July 2023
			</summary>
			<p>
				I served as a Student Trustee of SUSU - the University of Southampton Students' Union - in
				my final year of study at the University of Southampton. In this role I was responsible for
				ensuring the Union is operating in accordance with its policies, its objects and the law.
			</p>
			<p>
				I worked with a Board composed of members with a wide range of multidisciplinary
				backgrounds, and oversaw the beginning of a broad-ranging governance transformation project.
				I sat on the Union's Audit and Risk Subcommittee of the Board, working alongside external
				auditors examining risks including financial, reputational, and safeguarding risks.

				<strong>Unit Events Lead</strong>
				at St John Ambulance University of Southampton: June 2021 &mdash; May 2023
			</summary>
			<p>
				St John Ambulance is England's largest first aid charity, providing medical cover at events,
				in communities, and in response to emergency calls in partnership with the NHS. Student
				Volunteering Units in St John act as regular Event Services Units, and are trained and run
				to the same standard as any other adult unit.
			</p>
			<p>
				As Unit Events Lead of the University of Southampton unit, my role was to manage the
				deployment to events of students at the university giving up their time to volunteer with St
				John, and ensuring we appropriately staffed our events. I was also responsible for the
				operational management of volunteers, together with the Unit Manager and Unit Training Lead.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this role, my team and I grew our unit from a handful of volunteers to more than twenty,
				and successfully planned and delivered medical cover at numerous different events
				independently. This included Night-Time Economy medical provision in Southampton, providing
				out-of-hospital urgent and emergency care to service users overnight, preventing pressure on
				the statutory ambulance service and hospitals.

				<strong>Technical Officer</strong>
				at the University of Southampton LGBTQ+ Society: November 2020 &mdash; July 2022
			</summary>
			<p>
				The UoS LGBTQ+ Society is the Students' Union society for students from gender and sexual
				minorities (GSMs). In my role as Technical Officer, I was responsible not only for digital
				infrastructure, but also for data protection, which is critically important in a society for
				GSM students.
			</p>
			<p>
				As well as designing a new authentication system in PHP and Discord bot in Go,
				I worked directly with the Students' Union's leadership to create appropriate technical and
				organisational measures to protect members' data, establish the Society's legal relationship
				with the Union, and investigate options to inject member data into insurance "pools" without
				the Union itself having a record of their membership of the Society.
