	<h2>Curtis Parfitt-Ford</h2>

	<p>
		I'm a candidate who offers the advantages of someone with experience in the industry alongside a
        <strong>fresh and highly motivated mind</strong>, with a keen and curious interest in technology and digital regulation.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>I passionately believe in the power of humans combined with software to change the world for
			good</strong>, and see myself as someone who can help lead that change. Having
		<strong>founded my own company</strong>
		just two months after turning 17 to help campaigns I believed in realise their goals, I've got
		clear experience working in a <strong>self-motivated</strong> fashion to achieve key objectives.
		Unlike many other candidates, I bring this experience on day one -
		<strong>soft skills along with the technical experience</strong> coming with it - meaning a faster
		onboarding process and a greater value to your team.

				I served as a Student Trustee of SUSU - the University of Southampton Students'
				Union - in my final year of study at the University of Southampton. In this role I was responsible for ensuring the Union is operating in accordance with
				its policies, its objects and the law.
			</p>
			<p>
				I worked with a Board composed of members with a wide range of multidisciplinary backgrounds, and oversaw the beginning of a broad-ranging governance transformation project. I sat on the Union's Audit and Risk Subcommittee of the Board, working alongside external auditors examining risks including financial, reputational, and safeguarding risks.

				The UoS LGBTQ+ Society is the Students' Union society for students from gender and sexual
				minorities (GSMs). In my role as Technical Officer, I was responsible not only for digital
				infrastructure, but also for data protection, which is critically important in a society for
				GSM students. As well as designing a new authentication system in PHP and Discord bot in Go,
				I worked directly with the Students' Union's leadership to create appropriate technical and
				organisational measures to protect members' data, establish the Society's legal relationship
				with the Union, and investigate options to inject member data into insurance "pools" without
				the Union itself having a record of their membership of the Society.
