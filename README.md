# Hi! This is my personal website.

It's live at https://cpf.sh/.

Use node 16 or greater to build - I use node 18.

To build, run `npm run build`.

To develop, use `npm run dev`, and vite will launch a local server.

n.b. due to imagetools dependencies, you need a version of libheif earlier than 1.17 for now to be able to build.
